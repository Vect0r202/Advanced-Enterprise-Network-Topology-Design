The project is not yet available, it is currently in the testing and final review phases. Estimated upload: 27.04.2024.

In my Advanced Enterprise Network Topology Design project, I constructed a robust simulation of an enterprise-grade network using Cisco Packet Tracer, emphasizing both complexity and high-level security measures. The project is designed around a multi-layer network architecture using VLANs to optimize traffic flow and segment the network efficiently, which is crucial for maintaining performance and security within a busy corporate environment.

The network features an integrated suite of essential services on the server side to ensure comprehensive functionality. These services include:

** Mail Services: Configured to handle both incoming and outgoing emails efficiently, ensuring secure and reliable communication within the network.
** FTP Services: Set up to provide a secure method of transferring files within and outside the network, utilizing user authentication to maintain security.
** HTTPS: Implemented to secure the web services, providing encrypted communication across the network to protect sensitive data.
** DHCP: Configured for dynamic IP address allocation, reducing manual configuration tasks and ensuring efficient network administration.
** DNS: Essential for domain name resolution, facilitating easier access to network resources through human-readable names.


Additionally, the network supports SSH for secure remote access, allowing administrators to securely manage network devices from remote locations. This is vital for maintaining network integrity and responsiveness in large-scale environments. Remote configuration and management are streamlined through the use of network management protocols and tools, enhancing the efficiency of network operations.

On the switching side, the project leverages advanced Cisco technologies, including:

EtherChannel: Utilizing the Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) to aggregate multiple links between switches into a single logical link, thus increasing bandwidth and providing redundancy for higher availability.
Port Security: Configured to restrict the incoming traffic on a switch port to a specified number of MAC addresses, which helps prevent unauthorized network access.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): Employed to prevent network loops that are common in highly interconnected networks, ensuring a loop-free topology.
This sophisticated simulation not only highlights my technical proficiency but also demonstrates a deep understanding of network design principles and the implementation of complex network services and security strategies in an enterprise setting.

The topology looks like this:
